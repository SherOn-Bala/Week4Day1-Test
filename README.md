### Coding test ###
1. Create a program which checks if the string has the correct order of parenthesis/brackets. ({})[] = true, []{]}[ = false
2. Given a string and a non-empty substring sub, compute recursively if at least n copies of sub appear in the string somewhere, possibly with overlapping. N will be non-negative.

strCopies("catcowcat", "cat", 2) → true </br>
strCopies("catcowcat", "cow", 2) → false </br>
strCopies("catcowcat", "cow", 1) → true </br>
